# Seismicity-and-Induced-Earthquakes
A project inspired by recent and ongoing 'Fracking' debate in the UK. The notebook has four sections. 
Firstly, it looks at whether RFM modelling and k-means clustering can be used to classify areas according to earthquake risk. 
Then, spatio-temporal seismic patterns are assessed. Linear regression is used to see if there is a correlation between UIC activity 
and earthquakes, before sentiment analysis is carried out on Twitter data.
